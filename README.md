# Netflix_EDA
Netflix is the leading OTT platform that has been in the top list since many years. It has started in the year 1997 as a DVD rental service and has since exploded into the largest entertainment/media company by market capitalization, boasting over 200 million subscribers as of January 2021. 
Given the large number of movies and series available on the platform, I thought it’s a perfect opportunity to flex and practice my data manipulation skills and dive into the entertainment industry. I have chosen Python as my programming language, especially using pandas for data exploration and matplotlib for visualizations, performing analysis and getting insights from the results.
Steps I followed in EDA process:
1.	Loading data into the dictionaries
2.	Creating a Data frame from the dictionary
3.	Visually inspecting the data
4.	Loading the rest of the data from the CSV
5.	Filtering for type “Movie”
6.	Creating a Scatter plot 
7.	Further analysis by different filters such as duration, genres.
